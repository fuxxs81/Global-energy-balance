### About the project

The analysis delves into the worldwide energy consumption trends and the consequences of political choices on energy equilibrium. It provides an overview about energy consumption in total, shows the status of green energy, and analyze risks of political decisions. 



### Slide deck details

### 

This repo is includes all raw and final files of my graduation project "Global energy consumption and the impact of political decisions on the energy balance".

##### 1

*Before we dive into this energetic journey, I have a fun little challenge for you. Please scan the QR code and participate in our sli.do guessing challenge.*

##### 2

*A leap back to 1962.*

*Imagine read the Life magzines and seeing this advertisement: "Each day ESSO supplies enough energy to melt 7 million tons of a glacier."*

*Feels like stepping into a time machine, doesn't it? But two things are glaringly obvious:*

- Oil companies had inklings of the impacts of their energy sources over 60 years ago.
- The consumption of fossil energy has skyrocketed by a staggering 430% since then.

*Think about it, in just one lifetime!*

##### 3

*"Numbers don't lie!"*

Here you see the total energy consumption worldwide in terawatt-hours and the face-off between fossil fuels and green energy.

"For those who took part in the sli.do game, let's see how close or off the mark you were!"

##### 4

Having gained a general insight into global energy consumption, let's zoom in a little closer.

##### 5

We've seen where we stand. How has green energy evolved over time?

- Within one dekade + 11percent points -> promising

##### 6

Highlighting some flagship countries in green development and a special focus on Germany. Seems like there's a "watery" issue here, doesn't it? So a huge chance for developing in this field

##### 7

With the next two slides, I want to point out the risks that can arise from wrong political decisions. I want to show this with 2 examples.

##### 8

 A look at Germany shows how evolving for solar energy has shiftet since the cut financial support for photovoltaic.

##### 9

The USA, a land of endless possibilities? 

USA rise from the biggest importeur of those energy sources to the biggest exporteur.



##### 10

 "As we near the end of our journey, I hope this presentation has shed some light on where we stand, and perhaps where we might be headed. 

The balance of energy is crucial for our future, and it's up to us to tip the scales in the right direction."
