# Slide details



## 1

*Before we dive into this energetic journey, I have a fun little challenge for you. Please scan the QR code and participate in our sli.do guessing challenge.*

## 2

*A leap back to 1962.*

*Imagine read the Life magzines and seeing this advertisement: "Each day ESSO supplies enough energy to melt 7 million tons of a glacier."*

*Feels like stepping into a time machine, doesn't it? But two things are glaringly obvious:*

- Oil companies had inklings of the impacts of their energy sources over 60 years ago.
- The consumption of fossil energy has skyrocketed by a staggering 430% since then.

*Think about it, in just one lifetime!*

## 3

*"Numbers don't lie!"*

Here you see the total energy consumption worldwide in terawatt-hours and the face-off between fossil fuels and green energy.

"For those who took part in the sli.do game, let's see how close or off the mark you were!"

## 4



Having gained a general insight into global energy consumption, let's zoom in a little closer.

## 5

We've seen where we stand. How has green energy evolved over time?

- Within one dekade + 11percent points -> promising

## 6

Highlighting some flagship countries in green development and a special focus on Germany. Seems like there's a "watery" issue here, doesn't it? So a huge chance for developing in this field

## 7

With the next two slides, I want to point out the risks that can arise from wrong political decisions. I want to show this with 2 examples.

## 8

 A look at Germany shows how evolving for solar energy has shiftet since the cut financial support for photovoltaic.

## 9

The USA, a land of endless possibilities? 

USA rise from the biggest importeur of those energy sources to the biggest exporteur.



## final

 "As we near the end of our journey, I hope this presentation has shed some light on where we stand, and perhaps where we might be headed. 

The balance of energy is crucial for our future, and it's up to us to tip the scales in the right direction."

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need.

Here's why:

* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
* [Laravel](https://laravel.com)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

* npm

```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```

### Installation

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
```

3. Install NPM packages

```sh
npm install
```

4. Enter your API in `config.js`

```JS
const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
```



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
